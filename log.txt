v2.6  Development history and notes
-----------------------------------

Oct 30, '00
 - began port to Win32.  Gutted all hardware IO routines in favour of
   class-wrapped style. (gfx.ShowPage, etc...)

Nov 2, '00
 - finished the gutting.

Nov 3, '00
 - Installed the message pump

Nov 6, '00
 - Got most of the DirectX stuff working.  All that's left is blits and
   debugging.  Started inserting DirectInput code.

Nov 12, '00
 - DirectInput code written, deleted, then rewritten twice. ;)
   It's now heavily based on vecna's Winv1.
 - More DirectDraw restructuring.  Should be sufficient now.
   Still some blits and primatives remain unimplemented.
 - Message pump rehashed.  Much better at maintaining co-operativity.

Nov 18, '00
 - Most of the blits and primitives are done.  Strange colour distortion
   with the 16bit RotScale.
 - Began mouse code.  Issues with keeping the cursor within the viewport in
   fullscreen mode persist.  No such problem in windowed mode.  ReadMouse()
   is now exactly the same as UpdateControls(). (it's kept for compatibility)

Nov 19, '00 - ultra-ultra early in the morning (or ultra-ultra late at night,
                       take your pick)
 - Fixed palettemorph.

Nov 21, '00
 - Fixed a (silly) bug in HLine.  It works now. (RectFill too)

Nov 22, '00
 - Tweaking.
   TODO: (as of the 22nd)
   *  There's a random bug that occurs where v2.6 just freezes.  It also stops
      processing messages, so, if it's fullscreen, you have to reset.  Stomp it.
   *  It doesn't work under Win2k.  Find out why.
   *  Write a custom blitter for when the screen and virtual screen pixel
      formats don't match, so that windowed mode works regardless of
      hardware.

Nov  25, '00
 - More tweaking.
 - Implemented the line() function. (lucent and opaque, 8 and 16bit)
   Undertested, but apparently perfect.

Nov 26, '00
 - Fixed the hicolour RotScale.
 - Implemented fixed addition/subtraction.
 - Implemented "vsync" in user.cfg.

Dec 4&5, '00
 - Dumped MikMod for the time being.  GCC doesn't like it.  Imported MIDAS
   instead.  Seems to work alright, cooperates with the OS properly thus far.
 - Re-implemented the console commands, RV and SV.  No apparent problems yet.
   Strings aren't implemented yet, though.
 - Fixed my own unpress code. Oops!
 - Re-implemented mapline and tmapline.  Absolutely untested, though.
 - Started redoing the mouse code.  Again.

Dec 6, '00
 - Finished mouse code.  Still some strangeness in windowed mode, but it
   should be okay, as long as the use doesn't depend on the windows cursor.
 - Co-operativity problems with MIDAS in DirectSound mode.  Added "safemode"
   option to user.cfg, since DirectSound is better, but doesn't always
   shut down properly when v2.6 is minimized.
 - Reimplemented mapline, tmapline, mask, changeall, and silhouette.
   Silhouette has been changed, however.  It's now:

   Silhouette(width, height, sourceimage, destimage, colour);

   Where width and height are the dimensions of the image, sourceimage
   is a pointer to the existing image, destimage is a pointer to a chunk
   of memory where the silhouette will go, and colour is the colour of the
   silhouette.  After doing that, you can blit it with copysprite/etc...
 - Added imagesize.  Returns the number of bytes for a specified image.
   Syntax  int i = ImageSize(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2);
 - Re-implemented flatpoly and tmappoly.  Undertested, but tested nonetheless.
   No apparent flaws.
 - Re-implemented hicolour palettemorph emulation.  Slower than it could be
   most likely, but not bad as it is.

Dec 7, '00
 - Fixed a bug that caused the console to not work.
 - Fixed Read/WriteVars, I think.
 - Fixed CircleFill
 - Corrected clipping in most blits.  It was one pixel short.
 - Double checked read/writevars.  Everything's cool, I think.
 - Fixed HookTimer

Dec 9, '00
 **** RELEASE! MWAHAHAHAHAHA! ****

Dec 10, '00
 - Removed a DirectDraw option in the ShowPage routine, since not all cards
   support DDFLIP_DONOTWAIT.
 - Fixed the fseekline bug. (again!)
 - Double checked readvars and writevars.  No apparent problems.
 - Fixed the user.cfg problems involving "sound_device" and other disabled
   options.
 - Rewrote part of CHRMAK16.  It should work better now.

Dec 11, '00
 - Made b1, etc.. and up, down, etc... writable again.  Why not?
 - Got my hands on some PNG code.  Thanks to Praetor, and indirectly,
   AegisKnight.  Not ported into the engine yet, but noteworthy nonetheless.

Dec 13, '00
 - Fixed a bug that caused writing to mx, my, or mb to also alter vctrace, and
   each other. @_x;

Dec 14, '00
 - VERGE now manually frees all it's memory in when it finds memory
   corruption, or Sys_Error (or it's VC equivalent, Exit) are called.
   Unsure if it's necessary, but it doesn't seem to be doing any harm.
 - Tweaked preprocessor, you can now #define a (5+3) without it going
   ballistic on you.  Well, Ear did it first, so give him credit for this one.

 **** Revision 1 released ****

Dec 18, '00
 - Fixed up the BMP code.  It should load up 24bit BMPs and bmps of odd widths
   now.
 - Fixed hicolour image loading stuff.  It now substitutes flat black for the
   mask colour again, like it should.
 - Tweaked file i/o.  The file io stuff now uses index handles, a la fonts.
   Much safer.  The only difference in implementation is that fopen and
   fwopen return -1 on error, not 0.  Consider changing this for
   compatibility's sake.  As a side effect, no more than 10 files may be
   opened simultaneously now.
 - Fixed fseekline yet again.  Actually tested it this time. ;)

Dec 19, '00
 - Finished the file i/o stuff.  Everything returns 0 on error again.
 - Entities that are turned off with entity.on are no longer rendered.

Dec 20, '00
 - Tried to convert tcopysprite to asm.  No luck.  Optimized it a bit,
   though.   (both 8 and 16 bit colour versions)
 - Fixed ReadVars and writevars, for real this time!

Dec 22, '00
 - Incorporated aen's newer string routines.  Should be considerably faster,
   as they are no longer dynamicly allocated.
 - Added aen's console stuff, which is now linked-list free!  Joy!

Dec 23, '00
 - Added PNG stuff.  Seems to work alright.  PNGs will not load in 8 bit
   colour yet.  Note that libpng1.dll and zlib.dll are necessary now. :/
   Also, I couldn't find the GCC libs for libpng, so if you want to compile
   it under ming, then you'll have to find them yourself. This build compiles
   under MSVC6.
 - The hicolour screenshot function was swapping the red and blue channels.
   Fixed it.
 - The entity wander code was ignoring the Delay property.  Fixed.

 **** Revision 2 ****

Dec 25 & 26, '00
 - Played with ASM in the graphics routines.
   * Wrote an MMX enhanced memory copier for showpage.  Squeezes an extra ounce
     of speed out of it.
   * Made some attempts to convert the 8 bit CopySprite to MMX enhanced ASM.
     Failed, but proven possible.
   * 8 bit CopySprite converted to ASM.  No real improvement,
     left commented out.
   * 8 bit TCopySprite converted.  ~%8 improvement in framerate.
   * 16 bit CopySprite converted to ASM.  Not much improvement, but it's there
     Kept it.
   * 16 bit MMX CopySprite written.  Faster yet on MMX enabled systems.
 - Learned something.  Showpage is slow purely because of the DX stuff going
   on.  There's nothing to be done about it, really.

Dec 27, '00
 - Converted the 8 bit ScaleSprite to ASM.  Superfast!

Dec 28, '00
 - Converted the rest of the nontranslucent ScaleSprites to ASM.
 - added built-in variables, "zone.event[]" and "zone.chance[]",
   cuz Zara was yelling at me. ;_;

 **** Revision 2.1 ****

Dec 30, '00
 - Tweaked the PNG loader.  It wasn't using valloc. (and it should)
   The result was a horrific memory leak.  Fixed.

 **** Revision 2.1.1 ****

Dec 30, '00
 - Event 0 can now have stuff bound to it.  Extremely handy for random
   battles.  Just set the battle event, and make the chance somewheres
   around 10. :)

Dec 31, '00
 - Hicolour CHRs weren't loading properly on 1555 cards.  Fixed.

Jan 3, '01
 - rstring console variable was broken.  Fixed.

Jan 6, '01
 - Fixed fseekline.  AGAIN.

Jan 8, '01
 - Minor tweaking.
 - Reinstated MMX showpage.  I'm not exactly sure when I disabled it, though.
   ^_^;
 - Tweaked keyboard code.  Unpress should work correctly now.

Jan 9, '01
 - More tweaking
 - "sound_device 3" in user.cfg disables sound again.
 - Added more error checking code here and there.  If it dies, at least
   you're more likely to get an error message, instead of a GPF. :D
 - Re-enabled stereo panning for sound effects.  I must've disabled it
   for debugging somewhere along the line.
 - Tweaked memstr.cpp and message.cpp.  v2.6 now compiles with no warnings. :D

Jan 17, '01
 - Apologized profusely for the lack of changes over an entire week. ^_~
 - Ditched MIDAS, implemented MikMod.  MUCH nicer sound,
   *cough*ITsupport*cough*  Less stable, however.
 - Made a horrifying discovery.  libPNG doesn't like __stdcall.
   No PNGs anymore. (TODO: ask someone who's smarter than me about how to
   fix it)
 - Converted the hicolour palettemorph emulation to ASM.  Framerate went from
   200 to 296.  VERY nice! ^_^

Jul 8, '01
 - Gutted audio and replaced it with v2.7's audio system.  MIDASxx.DLL is
   no longer required, however, sfx_mikmod.dll is.
 - bit_depth variable now returns 8 or 16. (purely so that it behaves
   the same as v2k+j)
 - "broke" fseekline so that it behaves like v2k+j
 - PNG stuff fixed?

 **** Revision 3 ****

Dec 8, '01
 - Removed DirectX.  Replaced with SDL.  Portable (!) and, in general, all-around
   better.
 - Replaced Air's mikmod with aegis's Audiere, which is both portable, and
   supports OGG and MP3, which is cute.  audiere.dll is now the required
   audio runtime.
 - Removed PNG stuff.  Nobody ever used it, it breaks compatibility, and it
   adds to the number of required DLLs in Windows.

 **** Revision 5 (where'd 4 go? O_O) ****

Whenever
 - Fixed mouse stuff

Feb 8, '02
 - Rewrote font stuff; I didn't like the old interface.  Behaves identically,
   though.
 - Used a newer version of Audiere.  No more MP3, but it should be win9x-friendly
   now.

Jun 6, '02
 - Fixed font stuff.  Was doing wacky things so it thought system.fnt was already
   allocated, which resulted in borkage.
 - Replaced image loaders with Corona.  Easier, smaller, less freaky.  'nuff said.
 - Rewrote VSP interface.  More modular than before. (which is good!)
 - Fixed cpu_info

Jun 7, '02
 - Started reimplementing entities
 - Started reimplementing the rendering pipeline.

Aug 3, '02
 - Entities almost completely redone.  Need to handle manual activation of zones
   and entities, and auto-activating entities.  Super-elite movescript implementation
   that nobody will really appreciate but me.
 - Rendering pipeline pretty pimpin now.  Need to reimplement tile animations.
 - Wiped most of the old entity code from the tree.  Wiped out a large section
   of engine.cpp (basically the player handling stuff)

Aug 4, '02
 - Replaced the big switch/case that VC uses to call stdlib with an array of
   function pointers.  Maybe faster, definitely cleaner.

Aug 16, '02
 - PartyMove works again.
 - Nuked old screenshot code in favour of Corona.  Hurray.
 - Still need to reimplement tile animations.

Aug 30, '02
 - Reimplemented tile animations. (finally!)

Oct 31, '02
 - Tweaked the VSP stuff.  I couldn't stand that stupid interface crap, since
   both implementations were virtually identical anyway.
 - Tweaked VC code to use vectors instead of C style pointer-arrays.
 - NEW_LOCALS isn't so new anymore.  Nuked all the #ifdef stuff that had the
   old local fallback code.
 - vcstack replaced with a std::vector
 - Fixed unpress.
 - Fixed colour keying problems. (I think)
 - C casts are retarded.  Fixed the vsp pointer, since (int) vsp was still legal,
   despite vsp now being a RefPtr<VSP::VSP> -_-;

Nov 2, '02
 - Changed the version number to r6 <:D
 - Fixed PaletteMorph in 8bpp mode.
 - Coded a simple VC profiler.  "profile" in user.cfg to activate.  Results
   outputted to vcprofile.htm (I wanted a nice table, and plaintext couldn't
   cut it)  The profiler imposes a significant speed hit, so don't turn it on
   when you don't need it.
 - ExecuteBlock was checking the message loop WAAAY too often.  Knocked it down
   by a factor of 500.  Massive speed increase.

Dec 12, '02
 - Rewrote console.
 - Removed all dependancies on string_k
 - Other tiny tweaks.
 - Played with the config file loaders.  Much shorter now.

Feb 26, '03
 - Tab complete in the console.
 - Reimplemented variable entity speeds.
 - Fixed:
   * Layer translucency.
   * Mouse input.
   * Typing an invalid console command resulted in it being added to the list of commands.
   * Entities can no longer walk off the map.
   * Alt-X works now. (both alt keys)
   * AllowConsole()

Mar 6, '03
 - Did some template-fu on the 16bpp graphics stuff.  Should be way faster.
   The graphics could be sped up further by writing separate graphics drivers,
   and extending an abstract class. (interface would be overkill)
 - fseekline behaves like it does in winv2 now.

Mar 12, '03
 - Fixed a bug in entity animation code.
 - Fixed some palette and translucency problems with the 8bpp code.

Mar 17, '03
 - VSP code wasn't loading animation data correctly.  Fixed.
 - MP3 was broken.  Fixed.

Mar 24, '03
 - Fixed entity wandering.

June 19, '03
 - Released as revision 7.
 
Nov 7, '03
 - Joystick code.  wee.
 
Jan 10, '03
 - Added 2xSaI, Eagle, Hq2x, Hq3x, and Hq4x filters to highcolour mode.
   2xSaI and Eagle implementations by Kreed <http://elektron.its.tudelft.nl/~dalikifa/>
   HqNx implemented by MaxSt <http://www.hiend3d.com/>
   This entailed adding NASM as a dependancy.  Whoops.
 - PaletteMorph works in 16bpp mode again. (go me!)
 - Changed version number to 9. (8 must have just been the joystick stuff)

==================================== Notes ==================================

- The key[] array and last_pressed are only updated after an UpdateControls()
  now.

- HookKey no longer operates while other VC scripts are running, only when
  the engine itself has control.

- Putting "window" in user.cfg will run v2.6 in windowed mode.

- The new function ImageSize(x1, y1, x2, y2) returns the number of bytes an
  image would require, taking pixel depth into account.  It's meant for
  GrabRegion, mask and such, so use it. ;)

Special thanks to Zaratustra for the application icon.
